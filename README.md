***NovaPulse Studio - Project: NovaR-Type***

Welcome to the official repository of NovaR-Type, a modern reimagining of the classic R-Type game. Developed by NovaPulse Studio, we are a team of passionate developers focused on bringing the retro run-n-gun space shooter experience to the modern world, blending classic gameplay with a fresh, neo-retro design. So what is R-type

**Introduction üèÅ**

R-Type is a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and released by Irem in 1987 and the first game in the R-Type series. The player controls a star ship, the R-9 "Arrowhead", in its efforts to destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind. The R-9 can acquire a glowing orbicular device called a "Force", protecting it from enemy fire and providing additional firepower. The arcade version was distributed by Nintendo in North America; it is the last arcade title Nintendo distributed.
